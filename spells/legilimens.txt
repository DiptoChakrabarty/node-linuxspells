Legilemency or legilimens is the act of magically navigating through many layers of a person's mind and correctly interpreting one's findings. Muggles often call this as 'mind-reading'.

It reads what is beneath the flesh of the person in wizard world, and somewhat 'cat' does the same in linux world. It reads the contents hidden beneath the flesh of a file :P

Usage : $ legilimens filename

Cheers!
